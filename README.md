This project is a refresh of my JavaScript skills and comfort level. I'm coding alongside Colt Steele's Modern JavaScript Bootcamp on Udemy (I highly recommend all his courses). 

This project has the following pages:
* shopping page on which the user can add items to their cart
* checkout page with all items that the user has added to their cart
* admin page on which admins can add items to the shop inventory
* log in page for admins

Note that the data store implementation is definitely not suitable for PROD. But I'm just here to practice. 

## Some Interesting Things
* Express.js now has body parsing included so you no longer need to use the `body-parser` npm package.
